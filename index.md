<p> Hi! My name is Anna Hollander. I am a junior at Lehigh University majoring in Journalism and Communications, with double minor in Music and Music Industry. This semester I enrolled in a Data Visualization class to learn how to tell powerful and effective stories in a creative and interdisciplainary way. Here is a sampling of the different types of Data Visualizations that I have created. I hope you enjoy them! </p>
