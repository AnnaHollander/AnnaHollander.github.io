<h2> "Without music, life would be a mistake."- Friedrich Nietzsche </h2>
<p> Hi! My name is Anna Hollander. I am a junior at Lehigh University majoring in Journalism and Communications, with double minor in Music and Music Industry. This semester I enrolled in a Data Visualization class to learn how to tell powerful and effective stories in a creative and interdisciplainary way. Here is a sampling of the different types of Data Visualizations that I have created. I hope you enjoy them! </p>
<h1> Comic Strip </h1> 
<p> Here is a comic strip I made using the program 'pixton.' to better tell you a little bit about myself. </p>

<h1> Timeline </h1>
<p> "That's one of the great things about music. You can sing a song to 85,000 people and they'll sing back for 85,000 different reasons." -Dave Grohl </p>
<p> I grew up in a family that lives and breathes Bruce Springsteen. I knew how to sing Born To Run before I could tie my own shoes. One of the most powerful qualities of music is it's ability to speak out against injustice and bring people together  during times of turmoil. I wanted to show how music is a reaction to what is happening in the world by showing political conflict based on the topic of Bruce Springsteen's songs. I decided to visually represent this unique quality of music through a timeline which was made using TimelineJS.</p>

<h1> Time Series Chart </h1>
"Music is forever; music should grow and mature with you, following you right on up until you die." -Paul Simon
<p> As someone who is always keeping up with new music, I wanted to see how popular music preferences have changed over an extended period. I created a line chart using chartbuilder to show how the popularity of different genres have changed in the U.S. over the past 10 years. </p>

<h1> Google Fusion Map </h1>
"Well, everybody faces the fact there really aren't many record stores around to just go and browse. Maybe browse online, yet that tactile feel of flipping though a stack of vinyl remains one of life's simple pleasures." - Billy Gibbons
<p> Listening to vinyl is like listening to music in its most lively and natural form. One of my favorite ways to spend free time is hidden in the record stores scattered around the lower east side. There is nothing as an incredible as the experience of discovering music while sifting through crates of unknown albums and artists. I decided to make a map using Google Gusion to make it easy for everyone to get lost in the bins of albums.

<h1> Interactive Map </h1>
<p> "Music is a world within itself; it is a language we all understand." -Stevie Wonder
<p> [Magic of live music. Love festivals, there is no better way to spend your time.  Truly shows how music brings everyone together and so much happiness.] I wanted to show the top festivals by location so I created an interactive map using Tableau. </p>

<p>"Ethinc diversity adds richness to a society."- Gary Locke
<p> As a student at Lehigh University who lived in a big city with incredible diversity, I wanted to see how diverse Lehigh is. I decided to create infographic using Canva to demonstrate the breakdown of races on campus. </p>
